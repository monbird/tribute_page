FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

This is the first of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp and the objective was to build a tribute page that meets Free Code Camp's user stories.

The page is purely informative and does not involve any user interaction.

You can find a list of requirements and further information on the project [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) and you can view the completed project by clicking [here](http://monbird.com/tribute-page/).
